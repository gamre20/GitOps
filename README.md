# GitOps
Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. ArgoCD GitOps ensures consistency in applications when you deploy them to different clusters in different environments, such as: development, staging, and production. ArgoCD helps you automate the following tasks:

* Ensure that the clusters have similar states for configuration, monitoring, and storage.
* Recover or recreate clusters from a known state.
* Apply or revert configuration changes to multiple Kubernetes clusters.
* Associate templated configuration with different environments.
* Promote applications across clusters, from staging to production.
